# Inference for non-probability samples under mis-classification error

## About

The project aims to develop new estimators for non-probability samples suffering from mis-classification error with an application to online job advertisements. New estimators of population means/totals will be proposed based on the literature on measurement error and state-of-the-art estimators such as mass imputation, inverse probability weighting or doubly robust estimators. The results of the project will include theory, simulation studies and novel job vacancy statistics based on the integrated online and survey data.

## Funding

Research funded by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) under The Bekker NAWA Programme, grant number BPN/BEK/2023/1/00099/U/00001 (visit at University of Manchester betwee 06.2024-09.2024)
